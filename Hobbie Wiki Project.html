      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <h3>Video Games</h3>

      <p>
        Video games has been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. Some of my
        favorite genres of games are open world, Role Playing, FPS's and as of
        recently rouge-likes. Currently I mostly play Nintendo Switch but I do
        like a lot of games on Playstation.
      </p>
      <h3>Music</h3>

      <p>
        I've loved music for as long as I can remember. As a child my mother
        would play music around the house as she cleaned. Later I would go on to
        create music of my own as well find new genres to enjoy.
      </p>
      <h3>Cooking</h3>

      <p>
        Cooking is something that I've always loved to do. It's always fun to
        try and create new dishes or just relax and cook for friends an family.
        Preparing meals for people and cooking for family has always brought me
        joy.

        <li>Comic Books</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Fashion</h3>
      <p>
        I developed an interest for fashion while i was working in retail. Being
        able to see all the different designers and styles plus help customers
        make selections was a very unique experience. Some of my favorite brands
        are Polo, <a href="https://crooksncastles.com/">Crooks & Castle</a>, New
        Balance and <a href="https://l-r-g.com/">LRG</a> to name a few.
      </p>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>
        I've only got to travel to a few places but it's something I've always
        wanted to do.I've been to
        <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/">New York City</a>,
        <a href="https://www.phila.gov/">Philadelphia</a>, and Jacksonville but
        there are still places in and out the country I'd like to see. In due
        time i'll make sure that I get a chance to travel as much of the world
        as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Comic Books</h3>
      <p>
        Before the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/">Marvel</a> movies I've
        always had a big interest in comic books. At one point as a kid I
        collected comic books and even figurines. I was and still am a big fan
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men">X-Men</a>, The
        Avengers, Cable, Bishop and X-Factor.
